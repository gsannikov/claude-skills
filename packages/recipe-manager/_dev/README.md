## ⚙️ Configuration

Recipes are stored as YAML files in your `exocortex-data` directory (default: `~/exocortex-data/recipe-manager`).

### `config/settings.yaml`
You can configure family members, cooking types, and Notion settings in the `config/settings.yaml` file within your data directory.

```yaml
family_members:
  - id: "user"
    name: "User"

types:
  - "Oven"
  - "Stovetop"
  - "Grill"
  - "No Cook"

notion:
  enabled: true
  database_id: "your-database-id"
```

## 🔄 Workflow

1.  **Capture**: Save a link to your "Recipe Inbox" Apple Note or just paste it to Claude.
2.  **Process**: Claude extracts ingredients, instructions, and metadata.
3.  **Store**: A YAML file is created locally.
4.  **Cook & Rate**: After cooking, tell Claude your rating and notes.
5.  **Sync**: Optionally sync to Notion for mobile access.
