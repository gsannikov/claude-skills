# STAR Story Scoring System - Reference Guide

**Module:** star-scoring-system.md  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Type:** Scoring Algorithm & Quality Assessment  
**Purpose:** Consistent quality evaluation of STAR stories

---

## 🎯 Overview

This document provides the detailed scoring algorithm for evaluating STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) interview stories. The system uses a 100-point scale broken down across the four STAR components plus overall quality factors.

**Total Score Breakdown:**
- Situation: 20 points (20%)
- Task: 15 points (15%)
- Action: 35 points (35%) - Most important
- Result: 25 points (25%)
- Overall Quality: 5 points (5%)
- **Total: 100 points**

**Quality Rating Scale:**
- 90-100: ⭐⭐⭐ **Excellent** (Interview-ready)
- 75-89: ⭐⭐ **Good** (Minor improvements recommended)
- 60-74: ⭐ **Fair** (Significant work needed)
- <60: ❌ **Incomplete** (Not interview-ready)
