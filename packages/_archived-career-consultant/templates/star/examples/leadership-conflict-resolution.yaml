  # Story: Resolving Architecture Disagreement Between Senior Engineers

  ## One-Line Summary
  Resolved a 3-week technical stalemate between two senior engineers over API design by facilitating a structured decision workshop, resulting in consensus in 2 days and keeping the project on schedule.

  ## Situation
  I was leading the payments platform team at a B2B SaaS company with 5M users. We were building a new API gateway that would be used by 3 other engineering teams. Two of our senior engineers—both highly respected—had been debating for 3 weeks whether to use REST or GraphQL. The debate had become increasingly heated, with each engineer refusing to compromise. Other team members were becoming frustrated and demotivated. We had a hard deadline in 6 weeks for the first integration, and we'd lost nearly half our buffer time to this disagreement.

  **Context Details:**
  - Platform/Product: New API gateway for payments platform
  - Team size: 8 engineers across 2 squads
  - Timeframe: Sprint 3 of 8-sprint project
  - Business context: 3 teams blocked, $2M revenue deal depended on completion
  - Challenge: Two experienced engineers entrenched in positions, team morale dropping

  ## Task
  As the Technical Lead, my responsibility was to:
  1. Break the deadlock and get to a decision within 1 week
  2. Ensure the decision was technically sound and had team buy-in
  3. Maintain the relationship and collaboration between the two engineers
  4. Keep the project on track for the 6-week deadline
  5. Prevent this from becoming a pattern for future technical decisions

  **Your Role:**
  - Responsibility: Final decision authority, but wanted team consensus
  - Constraints: Couldn't afford to lose either senior engineer, limited time
  - Goals: Technical soundness + team unity + stay on schedule
  - Why you: Only person with authority to make final call and both engineers' trust

  ## Action
  **What You Did:**
  - **Day 1 - Individual Conversations:** Met separately with each engineer for 1 hour
    - Asked each to explain their reasoning without interruption
    - Identified that both had valid technical concerns but were talking past each other
    - Discovered underlying issue: different assumptions about future requirements

  - **Day 1 - Framework Creation:** Created evaluation matrix with clear criteria
    - Performance, developer experience, learning curve, ecosystem, future extensibility
    - Weighted each criterion based on our actual business needs (not abstract "best practice")
    - Made the evaluation process transparent and objective

  - **Day 2 - Decision Workshop:** Facilitated 3-hour workshop with both engineers + 2 other seniors
    - Started with alignment on actual requirements (not theoretical)
    - Each engineer presented their case using the matrix (20 min each)
    - Collaborative scoring exercise for each criterion
    - Discussion of hybrid approach possibilities

  - **Day 2 Evening - Data Gathering:** Assigned homework to both engineers
    - Each built small POC of their approach (4 hours work)
    - Asked them to specifically test their weakest criterion from the matrix
    - Required sharing results honestly with the team

  **Key Decisions:**
  - **Workshop over decree:** Could have just made decision, but team buy-in was crucial
  - **Matrix framework:** Provided objective structure to replace subjective arguments
  - **POC homework:** Let data break the tie instead of authority or seniority
  - **Included other seniors:** Broadened perspective and prevented 2-person deadlock

  **Challenges Faced:**
  - **Challenge:** One engineer initially resistant to workshop approach
    - **Solution:** One-on-one conversation emphasizing their expertise would shine in structured format
  - **Challenge:** Workshop started rehashing old arguments
    - **Solution:** Enforced "no repeating previous points" rule, focus on matrix criteria only
  - **Challenge:** Matrix scores were close (GraphQL 72, REST 68)
    - **Solution:** POC experiments provided tiebreaker data

  ## Result
  **Immediate Outcomes:**
  - ✅ **Decision made in 2 days** (vs. 3+ weeks of stalemate)
  - ✅ **Clear winner emerged:** GraphQL scored 78 after POC data (vs REST 70)
  - ✅ **Unanimous agreement:** All 4 senior engineers aligned on final choice
  - ✅ **Project back on track:** Recovered 5 days of buffer time
  - ✅ **Improved relationship:** The two engineers actually became close collaborators after

  **Business Impact:**
  - **Velocity:** Team unblocked, sprint velocity returned to 32 points (from 18)
  - **Quality:** More thoughtful decision than either original position
  - **Timeline:** Delivered API gateway 2 days ahead of 6-week deadline
  - **Risk mitigation:** Avoided losing buffer time before integration

  **Personal Growth:**
  - **Learned:** Facilitation > directive leadership for technical disagreements
  - **Skill developed:** Creating objective decision frameworks
  - **Confidence gained:** Handling strong personalities and ego conflicts
  - **Relationships:** Strengthened trust with both senior engineers

  **Long-term Effects:**
  - Decision framework became team template for future architecture choices
  - Team culture shifted to "debate the framework, not each other"
  - Both engineers co-presented the API gateway at company tech talk
  - Promoted to Staff Engineer 4 months later, partly due to this leadership

  ## Key Takeaways
  1. **Structure beats authority:** Objective frameworks resolve disagreements better than directives
  2. **Ego needs a face-saving path:** Let data make the decision, not people
  3. **Speed matters:** 3-week stalemate was toxic; forcing resolution in 2 days was healthy
  4. **Involve the right people:** Including 2 other seniors prevented 2-person deadlock and built broader buy-in

  ## Interview Delivery Tips
  - **Timing:** 2 minutes for full version, 45 seconds for summary
  - **Emphasize:** Framework approach + team dynamics + quick resolution
  - **Show:** Leadership, conflict resolution, technical judgment, emotional intelligence
  - **Connect:** Links to team leadership, decision-making under pressure, conflict resolution
  - **Avoid:** Getting into technical details of REST vs GraphQL (unless specifically asked)

  ## Variations by Question Type
  - **"Tell me about a conflict you resolved"** → Lead with relationship aspect and team impact
  - **"Describe leading without authority"** → Focus on facilitation and influence techniques
  - **"How do you make technical decisions?"** → Emphasize the matrix framework and objectivity
  - **"Tell me about handling strong personalities"** → Highlight individual conversations and ego management
