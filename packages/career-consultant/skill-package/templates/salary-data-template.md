### Base Income Score (0-20 points)

Calculate based on offer vs. your minimum:

```
If offer < minimum:
  score = 0

If offer >= minimum AND offer < target:
  score = 10 + ((offer - minimum) / (target - minimum)) * 10

If offer >= target:
  score = 20
```

### Company Tier Bonus (0-5 points)
- Tier 1: +5 points
- Tier 2: +3 points
- Tier 3: +1 point
- Tier 4: +0 points

**Total Income Score**: Base (20) + Tier Bonus (5) = **25 points max**
