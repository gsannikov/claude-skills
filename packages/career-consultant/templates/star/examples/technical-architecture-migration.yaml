# Story: Migrating Legacy Monolith to Microservices

## One-Line Summary
Led 6-month migration from legacy Rails monolith to microservices for 5M user platform, reducing deployment time by 85% and enabling 4 autonomous teams, delivered under budget with zero downtime.

## Situation
At my previous company, our 10-year-old Rails monolith had become a critical bottleneck. We'd grown from 2M to 5M users in 18 months, but our deployment process took 4-6 hours and required coordinating all 4 teams. We could only deploy once every 2 weeks, and each deployment was high-risk. Leadership was considering a complete rewrite that would cost $2M+ and take 18 months. We were losing competitive advantage because we couldn't ship features fast enough, and engineer satisfaction was at an all-time low.

**Context Details:**
- Platform/Product: Core SaaS platform serving 5M active users
- Team size: 15 engineers across 4 product-focused squads
- Timeframe: Q1-Q2 2024 (6-month project)
- Business context: Losing deals due to slow feature velocity, considering $2M rewrite
- Challenge: Zero downtime requirement, maintain 99.9% SLA, no additional hiring budget

## Task
As Technical Lead, I was asked to find a solution that could:
1. Improve deployment speed and reduce risk without complete rewrite
2. Enable teams to deploy independently (reduce coordination tax)
3. Maintain system stability and meet 99.9% uptime SLA
4. Complete migration in 6 months with existing team
5. Stay within $500K budget (10% of the rewrite cost)

**Your Role:**
- Responsibility: Architecture, migration strategy, and execution oversight
- Constraints: Zero downtime, no hiring, 60% capacity for ongoing feature work
- Goals: 4x deployment frequency, team autonomy, <$500K spend
- Why you: Had led smaller service extractions before, team trusted my judgment

## Action
**What You Did:**
- **Month 1 - Analysis & Planning:**
  - Analyzed monolith codebase to identify 8 clear service boundaries
  - Created phased migration plan with 6 incremental releases
  - Built proof-of-concept extracting User Service to validate approach and tooling
  - Presented business case to leadership: $480K vs $2M rewrite, 6mo vs 18mo
  - Got approval and $500K budget allocation

- **Month 2 - Foundation:**
  - Set up Docker + Kubernetes infrastructure on AWS EKS
  - Created service template with monitoring (Datadog), logging (ELK), CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
  - Established API versioning standards and service communication contracts
  - Trained entire team on microservices patterns (circuit breakers, saga, etc.)
  - Set up API gateway (Kong) for gradual traffic shifting

- **Months 3-5 - Migration Execution:**
  - Migrated 8 services using strangler fig pattern:
    * User Service → Payment Service → Notification Service → Search Service
    * Product Catalog → Order Processing → Analytics → Reporting
  - Each migration followed same playbook:
    1. Extract code as internal service (still in monolith)
    2. Add dual-write to new service
    3. Validate data consistency for 1 week
    4. Gradually shift traffic (10%→50%→100%)
    5. Monitor for 2 weeks, then sunset monolith code
  - Maintained 60% feature development capacity throughout

- **Month 6 - Stabilization:**
  - Hardened monitoring and alerting across all services
  - Documented runbooks for each service
  - Conducted disaster recovery drills
  - Trained on-call rotation on new architecture
  - Measured and validated all success metrics

**Key Decisions:**
- **Strangler pattern over big bang:** Incremental migration reduced risk by 90%
- **Event-driven architecture:** Used Kafka for service communication (loose coupling)
- **API gateway for traffic shifting:** Enabled 0-downtime cutover for each service
- **Kubernetes over ECS:** Team had Docker experience, K8s provided portability
- **60/40 capacity split:** Kept feature development moving to maintain morale

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Challenge:** Data consistency across distributed services
  - **Solution:** Implemented saga pattern for distributed transactions, used event sourcing for critical flows
  
- **Challenge:** Team learning curve with Kubernetes and distributed systems
  - **Solution:** Pair programming, "office hours" 2x/week, internal Slack channel for questions
  
- **Challenge:** Testing distributed systems was complex
  - **Solution:** Built integration test harness, added contract testing with Pact
  
- **Challenge:** Monitoring 8 services vs 1 monolith
  - **Solution:** Standardized observability stack (Datadog APM, distributed tracing with Jaeger)

## Result
**Immediate Outcomes:**
- ✅ **Timeline:** Completed in 5.5 months (2 weeks ahead of 6-month target)
- ✅ **Budget:** $480K spent (under $500K budget)
- ✅ **Uptime:** 99.97% maintained (exceeded 99.9% SLA)
- ✅ **Zero downtime:** Not a single user-facing outage during migration
- ✅ **Feature work:** Delivered 95% of planned features during migration

**Business Impact:**
- **Deployment time:** 4-6 hours → 30 minutes (85% reduction)
- **Deployment frequency:** Bi-weekly → Daily (14x increase)
- **Team autonomy:** 0 → 4 teams deploying independently
- **Feature velocity:** Increased 40% by month 8 (after migration)
- **Incident recovery:** 2-3 hours → 15 minutes (87% improvement)
- **Cost savings:** $1.5M saved vs rewrite approach

**Personal Growth:**
- **First time:** Leading multi-month architectural initiative at this scale
- **Skills gained:** Distributed systems architecture, Kubernetes, service orchestration
- **Leadership growth:** Managing stakeholder expectations through 6-month project
- **Confidence:** Validated ability to deliver complex technical transformation

**Long-term Effects:**
- Architecture became blueprint for 2 additional migrations across company
- Published company engineering blog post that got 50K+ views
- Promoted to Staff Engineer 3 months after completion
- Speaking opportunity at regional tech conference
- 3 team members used experience to get senior promotions

## Key Takeaways
1. **Incremental beats big bang:** Strangler pattern reduced risk and maintained team confidence
2. **Invest in foundations:** Month 2 infrastructure work paid dividends in Months 3-5
3. **Team enablement is critical:** Training and pair programming ensured success
4. **Measure everything:** Metrics proved value and guided decisions
5. **Business + technical alignment:** Framing in business terms ($1.5M savings) secured resources

## Interview Delivery Tips
- **Timing:** 2 minutes for full story, 45 seconds for high-level summary
- **Emphasize:** Business impact ($1.5M saved, 40% velocity increase) and execution discipline
- **Show:** Technical depth (strangler pattern, saga, K8s) AND leadership (stakeholder mgmt, team training)
- **Connect:** Links to system design, technical leadership, risk management, team scaling
- **Avoid:** Deep diving into every service migration—focus on approach and outcomes

## Variations by Question Type
- **"Tell me about a technical challenge"** → Focus on distributed systems complexity and solutions
- **"Describe leading a large project"** → Emphasize planning, stakeholder management, team coordination
- **"How do you handle risk?"** → Highlight incremental approach, monitoring, gradual rollout
- **"Tell me about a successful project"** → Lead with business outcomes and team impact
