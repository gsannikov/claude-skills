**Exocortex** is a local-first system that extends your biological mind with AI, memory, and automated agency.
It integrates deeply with your environment—**Apple Notes**, **Filesystem**, and **Voice**—to create a seamless loop of capture, processing, and recall.
All data is stored in `~/exocortex-data`: Human-readable, human-owned, and forever capable.
