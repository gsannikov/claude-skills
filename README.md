**Exocortex** is a local-first system that extends your biological mind with AI, memory, and automated agency.
It integrates deeply with your environment—**Apple Notes**, **Filesystem**, and **Voice**—to create a seamless loop of capture, processing, and recall.
All data is stored in `~/exocortex-data`: Human-readable, human-owned, and forever capable.

## 🔄 Skill Workflow

### Job Search Flow
```
Job Analyzer                    Interview Prep
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Analyze: [URL]          →       Prepare for [company]
Track LinkedIn app      →       Practice STAR stories
Show reminders          →       Prep negotiation
```

Both skills share data in `~/exocortex-data/career/` for seamless handoff.
